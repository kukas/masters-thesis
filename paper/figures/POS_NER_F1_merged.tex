    \caption{Cross-lingual transfer for POS and NER tasks. The absolute values are presented for the Unigram tokenizer. For other tokenization methods, the color scheme shows a difference from the Unigram algorithm. In the case of NER, we observe a drop in cross-lingual transfer for \textsc{NoOverlap} tokenization, especially for the same script pairs, suggesting that lexical overlap is an important aspect contributing to cross-lingual transfer for NER. We don't see similar drop in the case of Part of Speech tagging.}
