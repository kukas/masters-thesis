    \caption{Cross-lingual transfer for Named Entity Recognition. The absolute values are presented for the Unigram tokenizer. For other tokenization methods, we show  the difference from the unigram algorithm. We observe a drop in cross-lingual transfer for \textsc{NoOverlap} tokenization, especially for the same script pairs, suggesting that lexical overlap is an important aspect contributing to cross-lingual transfer for NER.\jirka{maybe we should explain the colors in the heatmaps?}}
