In this chapter, we present \xxx{our theoretical findings} and the results of our experiments. First we validate the usefulness of our proposed vocabulary allocation and vocabulary overlap metrics. \xxx{We do this on a theoretical level by analytically contrasting our metrics to existing metrics used in the literature. Then, } train three tokenizers using the Huggingface Tokenizers library and assess whether they differ in the metrics we propose. We see that there are significant differences between the three tokenizers. Then we look at how these differences manifest, when we use these tokenizers to train otherwise identical multilingual models. We observe that the differences in tokenizers are reflected in the learned representations of the models. Especially when considering word-level downstream tasks, the learned contextualized representations are better when the tokenizer segments the text into longer tokens (high characters per token), when the tokenizer allocates tokens more uniformly (high average rank) and when there is less overlap between the languages (high Jensen-Shannon divergence).

Then we switch to the original Sentencepiece library, which is used in the related work we replicate \cite{conneau_unsupervised_2020,chung_improving_2020,zheng_allocating_2021,liang_xlm-v_2023}. We see that there are differences in the implementation of the Unigram and BPE algorithms between the two libraries and that the Huggingface library yields subpar Unigram tokenizers. We further assess other factors that influence the tokenizers quality, such as the total training data size, the size of the alphabet and most importantly the language imbalance in the training dataset. We observe that we need around 100k-1M lines per language to train a good, multilingual tokenizer. The alphabet size does affect the number of UNK tokens but does not have a significant influence on the rest of the metrics if we stay in the range of 1000-5000 alphabet size. As for the language imbalance, we observe that it does influence the per-language metrics heavily and that it lowers the tokenization quality for the low-resource languages more than it improves it for the high-resource. The last batch of experiment becomes the main baseline we use for comparing the next experiments.

Finally, we replicate the works of \citet{chung_improving_2020,zheng_allocating_2021,liang_xlm-v_2023} and create several variations of their tokenizers that aim to improve the text segmentations especially for the low-resource languages. We carefully compare these replicated tokenizers with the traditional method of training Sentencepiece Unigram tokenizers on a joint, multilingual corpus. 

While the beforementioned authors do compare their methods to the standard tokenizer training, the crucial difference in our methodology is that we compare their replicated language-balancing methods with the vanilla Sentencepiece tokenizer trained on a \textbf{balanced} multilingual dataset. We find that when compared to this stronger, yet simple baseline, the balancing approaches do not yield significant improvements on our proposed tokenizer metrics per-language nor in overall.

\xxx{maybe rewrite the previous two paragraphs, it is a bit confusing? Now on the second read it doesnt seem so bad}

We then validate our findings by training a second batch of masked language models that differ only in the tokenizer used. We choose the clustering method of \citet{chung_improving_2020} and allocation method of \citet{zheng_allocating_2021} and compare them with Sentencepiece Unigram tokenizers trained on balanced and unbalanced data. We observe that methods of Chung, Zheng and balanced Unigram improve the language modeling capabilities over the unbalanced baseline on the word-level tasks while having no impact in the sentence-level task. On the other hand, we do not observe significant differences between the replicated methods and the simple baseline of training the tokenizer on a balanced set which is in line with our previous assessment using only the tokenizer metrics. Our findings suggest that in our scaled down setting of 20 languages and 120k vocabulary size, the simpler method of training a tokenizer on a joint, balanced corpus is sufficient to create a good multilingual vocabulary that represents all languages well.

\section{Analytical comparison of the metrics}

In this section we compare the metrics we propose to the metrics used in the literature. We focus on each of our proposed metrics and draw connections to the metrics used in the literature.
% compare the average tokenized length \cite{chung_improving_2020,liang_xlm-v_2023}, average log probability \cite{zheng_allocating_2021} and we also draw comparison between our average rank and standard information entropy.

\subsection{Characters per token}

The CPT metric is connected to the average tokenized length (description length) metric used in \citet{chung_improving_2020,liang_xlm-v_2023}. The authors suggest using the metric to compare whether one tokenizer splits a selected low-resource language into more tokens compared to another tokenizer. The average tokenized length is defined as the average number of tokens per sentence: 
\begin{equation}
    TL(\tau, C_l) = \frac{\sum_{s \in C_l}|\tau(s)|}{|C_l|}
\end{equation}

Which can be expressed as the product of the reciprocal of CPT metric and the average sentence length, which is language-specific and not dependent on the tokenizer:
\begin{equation}
    CPT(\tau, C_l)^{-1} \cdot \frac{\sum_{s \in C_l}|s|}{|C_l|} = \frac{\sum_{s \in C_l}|\tau(s)|}{\sum_{s \in C_l}|s|} \cdot \frac{\sum_{s \in C_l}|s|}{|C_l|} = \frac{\sum_{s \in C_l}|s|}{|C_l|} = TL(\tau, C_l)
\end{equation}

Even though the metrics are equivalent \xxx{is this the word?}, we will use the CPT metric instead of the average tokenized length because we believe it is more intuitive (higher CPT is better) and it is easier to interpret thanks to the lower bound of 1.

CPT is also similar to another metric used in the literature --- the word fertility metric used in \citet{rust_how_2021}. The word fertility is defined as the average number of tokens per word. The fertility metric has been shown to correlate with downstream performance and therefore seems to be a good metric. The downside of this metric is that it is not language-agnostic because it is not defined for languages without word delimiters such as Chinese or Thai. 

\subsection{Average rank}

Now, we would like to address how does our \textit{average rank} compare to different metrics used in the literature. 

First we examine the \textit{average log probability} (ALP) defined in \citet{zheng_allocating_2021}. This metric is proposed for the same purpose as our AR metric. It is also said to measure language-specific vocabulary capacity and the authors claim that it is "penalized by the subword units with low-frequency". Surprisingly, we can show that the ALP metric is equivalent to the product of negative entropy and average tokenized length.

\xxx{todo fix the notation}
The ALP is defined as follows. Given a monolingual corpus composed of sentences $C_l = {s_1, ..., s_{|C_l|}}$ from the language $l$ and tokenized with vocabulary $V_\tau$, the average log probability is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    ALP(\tau, C_l) = \frac{1}{|C_l|} \sum_{j=1}^{|C_l|} \sum_{k=1}^{|s_j|} \log p_{uni}(s_{kj})
\end{equation}

We can simplify the formula by observation that the sum over the log token probabilities over the tokens of the corpus can be expressed as the sum over the unique tokens in the tokenizer vocabulary, provided we have the counts of the tokens in the corpus. We can then express the ALP metric as follows: \xxx{the equation is ugly and i guess the count definition is not needed}

\begin{align}
    ALP(\tau, C_l) &= \frac{1}{|C_l|} \sum_{t \in V_\tau} count(t, \tau(C_l)) \log \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \\
    \text{where}~count(t, \tau(C_l)) &= \sum_{j=1}^{|C_l} \sum_{k=1}^{|s_j|} \mathbbm{1}[s_{kj} == t]
\end{align}

From here we introduce the total number of tokens in the corpus $|C_l|$ and we can rewrite the ALP metric as follows:

\begin{align}
ALP(\tau, C_l) &= \frac{1}{|C_l|} \sum_{t \in V_\tau} count(t, \tau(C_l)) \log \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \\
&= \frac{1}{|C_l|} \sum_{t \in V_\tau} \frac{\sum_{t' \in \tau(C_l)} count(t', \tau(C_l))}{\sum_{t' \in \tau(C_l)} count(t', \tau(C_l))} count(t, \tau(C_l)) \log \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \\
&= \frac{\sum_{t' \in \tau(C_l)} count(t', \tau(C_l))}{|C_l|} \sum_{t \in V_\tau} \frac{count(t, \tau(C_l))}{\sum_{t' \in \tau(C_l)} count(t', \tau(C_l))} \log \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \\
&= \frac{\sum_{t' \in \tau(C_l)} count(t', \tau(C_l))}{|C_l|} \sum_{t \in V_\tau} \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \log \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \\
&= - TL(\tau, C_l) \cdot H(\hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)})
\end{align}

\xxx{the last derivation needs "lemma" that $\sum_{t' \in \tau(C_l)} count(t', \tau(C_l)) == \sum_{s \in C_l}|\tau(s)|$}

By analysis of ALP we see that the metric is composed of two metrics that are already well defined. Strangely, the metrics are multiplied together even though the effects of the metrics go against each other. On one hand the lower the token length the better (lower tokenized sentence length means longer and more meaningful tokens), on the other hand arguably, the higher entropy the better (more uniform distribution is better than very unbalanced distribution). It is not clear why would we want to multiply these two metrics together. The authors do not provide this analysis and discussion. \xxx{now interpretaion occured to me: the best ALP is achieved when we have short tokens that are balanced. So actually it could be interesting. But still the authors do not provide this analysis.}

\subsection{Average rank and entropy}

Next we will compare the Average Rank and information entropy. The entropy of the tokenized corpus is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    H(\tau(C_l)) = - \sum_{t \in V_\tau} \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \log \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t)
\end{equation}

We see that entropy provides similar characteristics as AR in the sense that more uniform distributions result in higher entropy and more tokens dedicated to a language also result in higher entropy. As we can see, the formula for entropy and AR differ only in the sign and one of the multiplied terms. The sign is not important as we are only interested in the relative values of the metrics. The difference in the multiplied terms is that AR uses the rank of the token, while entropy uses the log-probability of the token. 

To proceed with the analysis, we will assume that the tokens follow the Zipf's distribution. This is a reasonable assumption for natural language data and empirically it holds \xxx{add image}. The Zipf's distribution is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    p_{zipf}(t) = \frac{1}{rank(t) \cdot H_{|V_\tau|}}
\end{equation}

Where $H_{|V_\tau|}$ is the $|V_\tau|$-th harmonic number used as a normalization constant.

Taking the logarithm of $p_{zipf}(t)$, we get:

\begin{equation}
    \log p_{zipf}(t) = - \log rank(t) - \log H_{|V_\tau|}
\end{equation}

Now if we plug in the log-probability of the token into the entropy formula and leave out the constant as we are interested only in the relative values with a fixed vocabulary size, we get:

\begin{equation}
    H(\tau(C_l)) = \sum_{t \in V_\tau} \hat{p}_{\tau(C_l)}(t) \log rank(t)
\end{equation}

We see that under the Zipfian assumption, the entropy may be viewed as a "Average Log Rank". This may be empirically observed in the Figure \ref{fig:ar_alr_entropy}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/temp/ar_alr_entropy.jpg}
    \caption{Average Rank vs Average Log Rank vs Entropy}
    \label{fig:ar_alr_entropy}
\end{figure}

This provides us with an intuitive understanding of the difference between the two metrics. AR and entropy can be viewed as being related, with the difference being in their sensitivity to the rank of the tokens. AR, being directly related to rank, is more sensitive to changes in probability in lower-frequency tokens. This is because the weighted mean used in AR is more affected by linear rank values than the logarithmic rank values used in entropy calculation.

\subsection{Jensen-Shannon divergence}


Overlap in tokenization has been studied in \citet{wu_beto_2019}, although the metric used there was the absolute number of overlapping tokens. The benefit of JSD is that the metric takes into account the occurence of the shared tokens. This is important because some of the overlapping tokens may be for example infrequent emojis or other special tokens that do not carry much information about the language nor the actual overlap in more meaningful tokens.

\citet{chung_improving_2020} uses the Wasserstein distance (or the "earth mover's distance") to measure the overlap between two languages. We believe this is a mistake as the Wasserstein distance is defined for probability measures (probability distributions on a given metric space). The tokenizer vocabulary has no metric structure and the authors of the article do not specify how they define the metric on the vocabulary.


\section{The influence of tokenizer metrics on the language representation quality}
\label{sec:influence_of_metrics}

In this section, we present some of the results from \citet{limisiewicz_tokenization_2023}. We empirically establish that the metrics we propose are useful for assessing the differences between tokenizers. We also show that the differences in tokenizers are reflected in the learned representations of the models. 

% We train three distinct tokenizers --- Huggingface Unigram, Huggingface BPE and TokMix using the Huggingface Tokenizers library. The training data is the CC100 corpus sampled with the smoothing factor $\alpha=0.25$ which corresponds to the XLM-R tokenizer (there $\alpha=0.3$). For all tokenizers we choose the default  In the \ref{tab:20l_metrics} we see the overall macro average metrics for the three tokenizers. 

\input{tables/20l_metrics.tex}

In the \autoref{tab:20l_metrics} we see that the choice of the tokenization method largely influences the vocabulary allocation and overlap metrics. The Huggingface BPE tokenizer produces the most uniform allocation of tokens and the least overlap between languages. On the other hand, the Huggingface Unigram segments the text into shorter tokens and the average vocabulary overlap between all languages is much higher. The high overlap might be related to the low allocation as it is more likely that shorter tokens are shared between languages. Because we use the default Huggingface settings for the tokenizer training, the resulting tokenizers differ also in the vocabulary size. As we will discuss in \xxx{ref}, this difference is not sufficient to explain the difference between the tokenizers. Nevertheless the difference in alphabet size has an influence on the Chinese language. As we discuss in \citet{limisiewicz_tokenization_2023}, on the language level, the Unigram Tokenizer allocates more tokens to Chinese (as measured by the Average Rank metric) compared to the other methods. This is probably related to the alphabet size, where the majority of the low-occurence tokens might come from the less frequent logograms of the Chinese dictionary.

Next, we use the tokenizers from \autoref{tab:20l_metrics} and pretrain three masked language models with otherwise identical configuration and training data. We then evaluate the quality of the output representations of these models by probing the contextualized vectors against several tasks (XNLI, UD, POS, NER). We test the in-language and cross-lingual settings. The in-language setting are shown in \autoref{fig:pair_analysis_20L}.e show the relationship between our metrics and the downstream tasks. The probe performance is largely dependent on the tested language, to assess only the differences yielded by the use of different tokenizers, we center the per-language results on the mean across the three models. This way we can see only the improvements and deteriorations of the models compared to the mean. The metrics are centered in the same way. We can see that the differences between tokenizers are reflected in the representation quality. High CPT and AR metrics are correlated with better probe performance especially on the word-level tasks such as Part of speech tagging, Named entity recognition and Dependency labeling. Moreover the cross-lingual performance is also correlated with the JSD metric as shown in \autoref{fig:X_pair_analysis_20L}.

\xxx{maybe I can actually get rid of the scatterplots and just show the correlation tables from the paper. The problem is the mixing of 6 langs and 20 langs which I do not explain here.}

All correlations are summarized in \autoref{tab:corr_in_lang_20l} and \autoref{fig:corr_x_lang_20l}. The length of the tokens has a strong positive influence on POS, dependency labeling, and NER results ($r > 0.65$), while it does not significantly affect NLI results. The correlation between the average rank NER scores is weaker but still significant. Moreover, it is significantly correlated with XNLI accuracy with a medium coefficient $r = 0.56$. 

\xxx{what to do with JSD, in paper we present the 6 lang experiments. Here I wanted to keep things simple and focus on the 20 lang experiments. But it seems that for 20 langs the influence of JSD is actually positive for NER and there is $\approx 0$ influence on XNLI. }

Note that in this results section we have included only a part of the experiments from our paper \citet{limisiewicz_tokenization_2023}. Namely we focus only on the experiments that are based on the same 20 languages as the rest of the thesis. For our purposes we focus only on the more general conclusions. We refer the reader to the original paper for the full set of experiments, where we additionaly discuss in more detail which tasks are more affected by which properties of the tokenizers.

% Firstly, we see that the default settings of the Huggingface tokenizers produce very different alphabet sizes and in turn affect the UNK rate. As we will see later, this does not affect the metrics significantly.

This suggests that our vocabulary allocation metrics are good indicators of the tokenizers quality and higher vocabulary allocation leads to better downstream performance. Each data point corresponds to an average result over three seeds of probe training and evaluating on one of the languages. The results for each language are centered around the mean to account for the differences between languages.}

\section{The choices that influence the tokenizers quality}

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\input{tables/hugg_vs_sentpiece.tex}

As shown in the previous \autoref{sec:influence_of_metrics}, we observe that the Huggingface Unigram tokenizer leads to significantly worse metrics than the other tokenizers. We investigate this difference by turning to the original Sentencepiece implementation of the algorithm and running a comparable experiment with the different library. For comparison, we also train a comparable BPE tokenizer using the Sentencepiece. 

The results are presented in \autoref{tab:hugg_vs_sentpiece}. We see that the implementation has an effect on the tokenization and that the Sentencepiece Unigram tokenizers performs on par with the Huggingface BPE tokenizer. For this reason, we use the Sentencepiece implementation for the rest of the experiments.

\subsection{Data size}
\label{sec:data_size}

\input{tables/data_size_influence.tex}

We are interested in how much data is needed for the tokenizer training. For this experiment, we sample the same number of lines (1e3, 1e4, 1e5, 1e6, 1.5e6, 2e6 per language) for each language from the CC100 corpus. Then we train the Sentencepiece Unigram tokenizers on different amounts of data and compare the results in \autoref{tab:data_size_influence}. We see that the metrics improve with the amount of data, but the improvement is not substantial after 100k-1M lines per language. We use these results as a rule of thumb for the rest of the experiments and where possible, we use at least 100k but preferrably 1M lines per language for the rest of the experiments.

\subsection{Character coverage}
\label{sec:character_coverage}

\input{tables/coverage_influence.tex}

Because we observe the large difference in the alphabet size between Huggingface tokenizers (implied by the use of the default trainer settings of the library), we investigate the influence of this parameter on our tokenizer metrics. We train the Sentencepiece Unigram tokenizers with different character coverage (98\%, 99.5\%, 99.95\%, 99.995\%, 99.9995\%, 99.99995\% and 100.0\%) on balanced data sampled from CC100 with $\alpha=0.0$. and compare the results in \autoref{tab:coverage_influence}. The character coverage parameter determines, how many distinct Unicode characters are included in the vocabulary of the tokenizer. As expected, we see that there is a direct relationship between the character coverage, alphabet size and the number of unknown tokens in the validation set. We also see that our metrics are not largely affected by the alphabet size, as the alphabet accounts for at most 10\% of the whole vocabulary size 120\,000. The lowest vocabulary allocation metrics are on the extremes of the character coverage, where the alphabet size is either very small or very large. We assume that the small alphabet size leads to a large number of unknown tokens and the tokenizer is forced to segment words containing characters outside of the alphabet, as these unknown tokens might even be characters with diacritics. In the range of 1000-5000 alphabet size, we see that the metrics are not largely affected by the alphabet size. On the other extreme, the large alphabet size starts to take up a large portion of the vocabulary and the tokenizer might not have enough capacity to learn longer tokens. For later experiments, we use the Sentencepiece default character coverage of 99.95\%. When comparing tokenizers with different alphabet sizes, we are aware of the fact that the metrics might be affected by the alphabet size and we take this into account when interpreting the results.

\section{Tokenizer training with data imbalance}
\label{sec:tokenizer_training_with_data_imbalance}

\input{tables/data_balance_metrics.tex}

In this section, we present the tokenizers that become the baselines for comparing the related works we replicate. Our experiments with the data imbalance follow the original tokenizer training recipe from XLM-R and mBERT. The method is training the tokenizers on a corpus created by combining monolingual data in different proportions. On one extreme we have the $\alpha=1.0$, where all data available for each language is combined. On the other we have $\alpha=0.0$, where the data is sampled per-line from each language with the same probability. 

The contribution of our method is investigating how the language imbalance affects each language individually. Moreover, we investigate how the other proposed methods relate to all settings of $\alpha$, not only to the unbalanced settings of $\alpha=0.5 \textrm{ or } 0.7$ as is done in \citet{chung_improving_2020,zheng_allocating_2021,liang_xlm-v_2023}.

For the data balancing experiment, we train 5 tokenizers on an increasingly imbalanced corpus with $\alpha = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0$ using the CC100 with 20 languages. For $\alpha = 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7$ we make sure to sample at least 100k lines per language as we have found this to be important in \autoref{sec:data_size}. We note that the data imbalance for $\alpha=1.0$ is so large, we needed to settle for 30k-70k training lines for the five least resourceful languages (ka, ur, te, mr, sw) because of memory constrants. We use the Sentencepiece Unigram tokenizer with the default settings. Specifically we use the default character coverage 99.95\%. We evaluate the tokenizers on a balanced validation set sampled from holdout portion of the CC100 corpus. 

The overall results with metrics macro averaged over the 20 languages are presented in \autoref{tab:data_balance_metrics}. The results demonstrate a clear disparity in the quality of tokenization depending on the data balance. Training on balanced data leads to higher overall metrics than on unbalanced data. The imbalance also affects the alphabet size as it is possible to cover 99.95\% of the characters in the training data with smaller alphabet because of overrepresentation of few high-resource languages.

We explore the reason for the decreasing performance of the tokenizers trained on imbalanced data in \autoref{fig:data_balance_vs_allocation_per_lang}. We plot the differences in vocabulary allocation metrics between the most unbalanced tokenizer $\alpha=1.0$ and the rest of the tokenizers. We sort the languages by the data size available starting with the highest-resource languages and ending with the low-resource. We see that the vocabulary allocation metrics for the high resource languages (en, vi, ru, fr, es, th) are improving with the data imbalance. On the other hand, the low resource languages (ka, ur, te, mr, sw) are disproporionally more affected by the imbalance and their vocabulary allocation metrics are decreasing significantly. This suggests that the marginal benefit of adding more data to the high resource languages is lower than the incurred cost on the quality of tokenization for the low resource languages. We see this tradeoff in the \autoref{tab:data_balance_metrics} as a overall decrease in the average CPT and AR.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ar_cpt_vs_alpha.pdf}
    \caption{We examine the impact of the language imbalance on the Sentencepiece Unigram tokenizer training. We train five tokenizers with an increasing language imbalance controlled by the $\alpha$ parameter. Then we look at the effect on the vocabulary allocation metrics per language. We center the results using the most unbalanced tokenizer with $\alpha=1.0$. As expected, the more balanced tokenizers have higher vocabulary allocation scores for low resource languages and lower scores for high resource languages. Interestingly, the effect varies across languages. For example the vocabulary allocation of high-resource Vietnamese or French is not as affected by the decrease in training data as English or Russian. \xxx{We also observe that the data imbalance negatively affects the low resource languages more than it positively affects the high resource languages. This suggests that the marginal benefit of adding more data to the high resource languages is lower than the incurred cost on the quality of tokenization for the low resource languages. <- is this a good interpretation?}}

\section{Comparison of balancing methods}

\input{tables/all_tokenizers_metrics.tex}

In this section, we compare the tokenizers we replicated following the works of \citet{chung_improving_2020,zheng_allocating_2021,liang_xlm-v_2023}. For each of the clustering methods (Chung, Liang), we create 4 variants with different number of clusters (4, 8, 16, 20) as that is the main hyperparameter of the methods. For Zheng, we create one variant by greedily maximizing the ALP metric across the 20 languages. We present the results alongside the rest of the experiments in this chapter to provide context a be better able to interpret the differences between the methods.

In \autoref{tab:all_tokenizers_metrics}, we compare overall metrics for all tokenizer experiments. We sort the table by the CPT metric. We see that the unbalanced tokenizers ($\alpha=1.0, 0.7$) are placed at the bottom of the results along with the underperforming Huggingface Unigram implementation. We see that generally, Chung provides the best overall allocation metrics, comparable to Huggingface BPE and Sentencepiece Unigram trained on balanced dataset. Next is the Zheng method and last is the Liang. We visualize our vocabulary allocation metrics on a scatterplot in \autoref{fig:all_tokenizers_AR_vs_CPT} to better observe the differences between the tokenizers and explore the relationship between CPT and AR. Each point on the scatterplot is one tokenizer and its position is determined by the CPT and AR metrics. We connect related experiments with a line and color-code them. Here we can see that the tokenizers with high CPT often have high AR. Nevertheless, we also have tokenizers with low AR and high CPT but never the other way around. Our intuition is that it is not possible to construct a tokenizer with high number of useful tokens which are all very short. Now with the context of different tokenization methods, we can see the degree of Huggingface Unigram underperformance.

Crucially, we see that the reproduced methods of \citet{chung_improving_2020,zheng_allocating_2021,liang_xlm-v_2023} do improve over the unbalanced baselines $\alpha=1.0, 0.7, 0.5$ but do not outperform the simple case of training the Sentencepiece Unigram on a balanced dataset $\alpha=0.0$. 

We also explore the relationship between vocabulary allocation and vocabulary overlap on the \autoref{fig:all_tokenizers_AR_vs_JSD}\footnote{The CPT-JSD plot is similar but is less readable therefore we present the relationshop between AR and JSD}. We see that the differences between all methods based on Sentencepiece are small compared to the differences between Huggingface tokenizers. This is surprising because one of the motivations for the method of Chung and Liang is to promote overlap between similar languages while minimizing overlap between distant languages. We would therefore expect the overall overlap to decrease, as the number of spurious token sharing decreases. Nevertheless we observe that the resulting overlap stays in the range of the original Sentencepiece Unigram. Similarly, Zheng method works by training separate tokenizers for each language and then combining them into one. We would expect the overlap to be even lower than the original Sentencepiece Unigram but we observe that the overlap is comparable. 
Surprisingly, the lowest vocabulary overlap (highest JSD) is achieved by the Huggingface BPE.

    \caption{We visualize the overall vocabulary allocation metrics for all tokenizers from Table \ref{tab:all_tokenizers_metrics}. We observe that the vocabulary allocation scores are related --- higher AR usually means higher CPT.  We also observe that Huggingface Unigram is a clear outlier, although combination of separate, monolingual Huggingface Unigrams (TokMix) approaches the performance of the Sentencepiece Unigram with the corresponding data imbalance ($\alpha=0.3$). We again see, that the balancing methods, especially Chung and Zheng overperform the unbalanced baselines ($\alpha=0.7$, $\alpha=0.5$) but perform similarly or worse to the simple case of running the Sentencepiece Unigram trainer on a balanced set $\alpha=0.0$.}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/all_tokenizers_AR_vs_JSD.pdf}
    \caption{We visualize the tokenizers from Table \ref{tab:all_tokenizers_metrics} in terms of Average Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Here we can see that all methods based on Sentencepiece result in similar overlap independent of the allocation. This is interesting because the replicated balancing methods (Chung, Zheng, Liang) work by splitting the data and training separate tokenizers. Nevertheless, after merging the separate subtokenizers they all seem to end up with similar vocabulary overlaps. The highest vocabulary isolation is surprisingly achieved by the Huggingface BPE tokenizer, which is contrary to the hypothesis stated by \citet{chung_improving_2020,zheng_allocating_2021} that the tokenizers trained on the concatenation of all data tend to select subwords shared across all languages.}
    \label{fig:all_tokenizers_AR_vs_JSD}
\end{figure}

We investigate the differences between the balanced Unigram and the replicated methods in more detail by examining the CPT and AR metrics computed per language. We use the data balance experiments from \autoref{sec:tokenizer_training_with_data_imbalance} for comparison. We start by comparing the Zheng method with the increasingly imbalanced Unigram tokenizers in \autoref{fig:zheng_vs_alphas}. We plot the increase or decrease in vocabulary allocation metrics for each language sorted by the data available, similar to the \autoref{sec:tokenizer_training_with_data_imbalance}. Remarkably, we see that the Zheng method is similar in terms of CPT and AR per language to the Unigram tokenizer trained on the balanced set $\alpha=0.0$. The similarity seems to be higher in the CPT metric although the AR metric is also very similar especially for the highest and lowest resource languages. We find this result quite surprising because of the distinctness of the Zheng method --- it trains a separate tokenizer for each language and then merges them together. Nevertheless, the resulting tokenizers are very similar to the Unigram tokenizer trained on the balanced set. This result seems to validate the choice of the ALP metric for the selection of vocabulary sizes in the Zheng method (see \autoref{fig:zheng_vs_alphas_alp}) but it also calls into question the necessity of the separate training of tokenizers for each language. One advantage of the Zheng method is that by splitting the data into separate languages it lowers the memory requirements for the training of the separate Sentencepiece Unigram although the compute-time is higher because of the need for training hundreds of tokenizers to be able to select the ones that maximize the overall ALP after merging them.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/zheng_vs_alphas.pdf}
    \caption{We zoom into the results of the Zheng method and compare the vocabulary allocation across the individual languages represented by this tokenizer against the backdrop of the vanilla Unigram tokenizers trained with different data imbalances from \ref{fig:data_balance_vs_allocation_per_lang}. We observe a striking similarity between the vocabulary allocation of the Zheng tokenizer and the Unigram tokenizer with $\alpha=0.0$, especially in terms of characters per token. This comes as a large surprise because the Zheng method works by training a separate tokenizer for each language and then merging them together. Despite the different method of obtaining the vocabulary, the resulting tokenizers are very similar across the languages.}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/zheng_vs_alphas_alp.pdf}
    \caption{Intrigued by the similarity between the Zheng tokenizer and the Unigram tokenizer with $\alpha=0.0$ from Figure \ref{fig:zheng_vs_alphas} we also look at the ALP metric which is used for the selection of vocabulary sizes in the Zheng method. Here we see that the greedy optimization of ALP across languages indeed results in a similar vocabulary allocation as the Unigram tokenizer with $\alpha=0.0$.}
    \label{fig:zheng_vs_alphas_alp}
\end{figure}

Next we inspect the Chung method and compare it in detail to our Unigram tokenizers in \autoref{fig:chung_vs_alphas}. We observe a similar trend as in the Zheng method --- the Chung method is very similar to the Unigram tokenizer with $\alpha=0.0$ with respect to CPT and .

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chung_vs_alphas.pdf}
    \caption{Here we inspect the language-level vocabulary allocation of the Chung method. Similarly to the Zheng method, the Chung method also performs similarly to the Unigram tokenizer with $\alpha=0.0$. Unfortunately, we believe this is an artifact of the choice of our training data for the Chung method. We use a balanced dataset ($\alpha=0.0$) for training the cluster-specific tokenizers. The balance of the data seems to be more important than the clustering step. After merging the cluster-specific tokenizers, the resulting tokenizer is very similar to the Unigram tokenizer with $\alpha=0.0$.}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{We select the best performing balancing method by \citet{chung_improving_2020} from our replications based on our tokenizer metrics and compare it with the vanilla Unigram tokenizers. We choose the unbalanced Unigram tokenizer with $\alpha=1.0$ and then two stronger baselines with $\alpha=0.0$ and $\alpha=0.3$ trained on more balanced data. We then pretrain masked language models that differ only in the tokenizer they use and assess the performance of these models on the downstream tasks using probing. We test two settings --- in-language performance, where the model is trained on each of the available languages and then evaluated on the same language, and cross-language performance, where the model is also trained on each language but evaluated on all \textit{but} the training language. We observe that for word-level tasks all balanced tokenizers (where $\alpha\neq1.0$) perform significantly better than the unbalanced Unigram. Moreover we see that the differences between the individual balancing methods seem to be minimal. For sentence-level NLI, we do not observe any systematic effects as the differences between the runs are quite low (<1\% accuracy).
    The results are a macro average over all the languages (in-language results) or language pairs (cross-language results). For each model and language we do 3 probe training runs with different random seeds. The error bars represent one standard deviation computed with bootstrapping by randomly sampling seeds for each language. Note that even though the probe training is done with three different random seeds, the model pretraining was done only once. The variance between pretraining runs is therefore not measured and the error bars should be interpreted as such.}

The balancing methods improve the language representations for the word-level tasks. For the sentence-level tasks, we do not observe any systematic effects. This might be in part due to the fact that the NLI task does not include 4 of our low-resource languages. The error bands are one standard deviation computed from the three probe training runs with different random seeds.}
